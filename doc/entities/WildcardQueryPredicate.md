# **WildcardQueryPredicate**
**namespace:** laplacian.arch.backend.api.elasticsearch.query

The wildcard search query. Supported wildcards are *, which matches any character sequence
(including the empty one), and ?, which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow,
as it needs to iterate over many terms. In order to prevent extremely slow WildcardQueries,
a Wildcard term should not start with one of the wildcards * or ?.
(The wildcard field type however, is optimized for leading wildcards)
