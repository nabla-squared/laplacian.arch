- name: wildcard_query_predicate
  namespace: laplacian.arch.backend.api.elasticsearch.query
  supertype_name: elasticsearch_query_predicate
  subtype_key_value: wildcard
  description: |
    The wildcard search query. Supported wildcards are *, which matches any character sequence
    (including the empty one), and ?, which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow,
    as it needs to iterate over many terms. In order to prevent extremely slow WildcardQueries,
    a Wildcard term should not start with one of the wildcards * or ?.
    (The wildcard field type however, is optimized for leading wildcards)

  properties:
  - name: field
    type: string
    description: |
      Field you wish to search.

  - name: value
    type: string
    description: |

  - name: boost
    type: double
    optional: true
    description: |
      Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of a query.

  - name: case_insensitive
    type: boolean
    optional: true
    description: |
      Allows ASCII case insensitive matching of the value with the indexed field values when set to true.
      Default is false which means the case sensitivity of matching depends on the underlying fieldâ€™s mapping.

  - name: rewrite
    type: string
    optional: true
    domain_type_name: elasticsearch_rewrite_parameter
